## Product Description

Apex Trader MT5 is an expert advisor designed to automate trading strategies based on mean-reversion and trend-following indicators. It is suitable for traders who want to automate their trading and take advantage of market opportunities.

The EA allows customization of input parameters such as lot size, maximum number of positions, take profit level, grid step, grid multiplier, minimum and maximum equity percentages. This provides flexibility to adapt the EA to different trading styles and risk preferences.

The EA scans selected currency pairs and calculates mean-reversion and trend-following indicators. When the conditions for opening a position are met, the EA opens a new position with a position size based on the equity percentage. The EA continues opening positions until the maximum number of positions is reached or the equity percentage exceeds the maximum threshold.

To ensure optimal performance, the EA adjusts the take-profit level based on market conditions. It also provides error handling functionality and support for bug fixes.
